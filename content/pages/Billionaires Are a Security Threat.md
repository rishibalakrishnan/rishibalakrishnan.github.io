The overly conservative approach to intellectual property that makes things proprietary in the first place is also a liability that compromises everything a company might create because it empowers billionaires to kill them.

Blockchains fight this problem on the deepest level possible. It would be vastly more difficult, or perhaps impossible, for Musk to kill off a blockchain so long as a handful of users objected enough to continue operating independent nodes. Duplicating across many computers means the risk of losing access is infinitesimal; the blockchain is its own API. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmstp29tbd2zrr8bhjy9ptsg))

  + Theoretically more censorship-resistant but not sure if the economics around current blockchain means that this actually plays out

Even after buying Twitter and [dropping down the list](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/elon-musk-was-overtaken-as-richest-person-in-the-world-briefly/ar-AA150YW5) of the wealthiest people in the world, Musk still has enough money to cover the valuations of npm, GitHub, GitLab, and Keybase combined, and could buy them and kill them off. He could not kill off the codebases they contain, though, since every project could just migrate to a new remote. Git was explicitly engineered to remain outside the reach of bad actors no matter how much money they have, and to propagate that powerful property into all the code it touches.

  + I feel like this goes back to the original [[Open Source]] movement which was rooted in the idea that knowledge/software should be freely accessible

Wikipedia, the greatest work of human knowledge of all time and the single most important thing ever created on the web. It was routinely mocked as absurd in its earliest days, but it is by now deeply woven into our lives—it lives in your pocket all the time, and you can pull it out at a bar and talk about an article with your friend or date. We take it for granted. Its value cannot be quantified. Somehow, it is also free. So in medicine, finance, and art, we should be trying to create a spiritual equivalent of Wikipedia that does whatever the discipline requires. Math, cooking, memories of dead loved ones.

Capital can kill code. Capital can kill anything. So if what you have created is important, then so long as billionaires still exist, you are going to need to turn it into something that can’t be bought. An idea that can’t be killed is more valuable than an idea that can be killed, and the only thing that billions of dollars cannot kill is something that cannot have a price tag to begin with, because it exists in abundance, endlessly replicating as it spreads across the world.

  + This is actually a very good explanation of why something probably needs to be public/decentralized for it to be censorship-resistant
