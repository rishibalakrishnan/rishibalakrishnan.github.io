Each of these problems is a tragedy of the commons problem. The users of virus infected computers are incentivized to save money rather than purchasing a product or service to rid their computer of the infection. While there are solutions such as egress filtering which decrease the problem, ISPs are incentivized to implement as little security as possible because they are not directly affected. Denial of service, whether by packet flooding or by faux legal action, benefits the attacker who is able to hide the truth or victimize service providers as well as organizations who make it their business to provide DoS related services. The victim who all too often publishes information for no other reason than satisfaction of telling the truth, is the only party harmed by this type of attack, and he is the least able to prevent it. Address space deaggregation benefits the edge ISPs who gain more flexibility in how their network is organized at the cost of the core ISPs whose only defense is the "we will not route that" nuclear option which would no doubt bring about a revolt from the edge ISPs.
