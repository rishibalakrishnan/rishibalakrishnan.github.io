During Occupy Wall Street, for example, an Internet-based discussion forum “forum was good, but a lot of it was from people who were not in New York City,” says [Dan Phiffer](http://phiffer.org/), an artist and technologist at The New Yorker. “I didn’t feel like it was serving the people who were actually in the space that well.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmq27efys7ags7wqtdjd2pdf))

At Occupy Wall Street, Phiffer deployed a chat forum and content repository run off a small wifi router and USB stick he dubbed [occupy.here](http://occupyhere.org/). Though anyone with a wireless device could participate, it was only accessible to those in range of its signal, which reached a few hundred feet.

  + Mesh networks [support local communication]()

Indeed, part of the appeal of these networks is their censorship resistance, a topic of increasing importance in news and communications in general, thanks to both political actions and legal policies like [Europe’s right to be forgotten](http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/right-to-be-forgotten-bbc-the-guardian-daily-mail-push-back-on-google-20140703-zsu9a.html). And in times of network overload or even crisis, these systems can be much more resilient than traditional, centralized Internet connections.

  + Mesh networks [are censorship resistant]()

Though a connection in time of disaster was crucial, “the big takeaway is working with your community,” says Bullen. Even before the storm, there was local interest ways to stay informed about issues and events in Red Hook. Today, a visit to [redhookwifi.org](http://redhookwifi.org/#/) returns a list of community events like public hearings and job fairs.

Today the network itself is maintained by “digital stewards” recruited from and trained within the community, which Bullen sees as integral to the value of the effort — both in a crisis and day-to-day: “The more people who know how to do this, the more control we have over the infrastructure, and the ability to fix it if something goes wrong.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmq2ad51zkpd3kjvq58212xp))

  + Also part of the reason that mesh networks are more resilient during [natural disasters]()

Just because digital news operations no longer need a physical plant to get started doesn’t mean they don’t need to be concerned about their distribution infrastructure, says Stamm. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmq2bz0t4bmy1fd10td2wzws))

If news organizations owned the wireless routers, it might give them an upper hand when it comes to advertising, since metrics wouldn’t have to be shared with an online ad network. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmq2jzgrcb8mksnd3pq41mg8))
