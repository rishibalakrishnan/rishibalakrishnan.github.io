Democracy is based on a model, an original idea, that can be copied from one place to the next. ... Once one has made democracy into something that moves around the world as an idea, in order to move with it, one is committed to a particular way of explaining how the idea works, how people become democratic. If democracy is an idea, then countries become democratic by the idea getting into people’s heads. (Location 68)

if oil appears to affect the producer states largely after its transformation into flows of money, that appearance reflects the building of pipelines, the placing of refineries, the negotiation of royalties, and other arrangements that from the start, in their effort to evade the demands of an organised labour force, were concerned with questions of carbon democracy. The transformation of oil into large and unaccountable government incomes is not a cause of the problem of democracy and oil, but the outcome of particular ways of engineering political relations out of flows of energy.

As coal and oil become more scarce and the difficulty in extracting them increases, the cost and the expenditure of energy their extraction requires will bring the era of fossil fuels to an end, with consequences that we cannot know. (Location 145)

In the case of oil, the fossil fuel that was the easiest to extract but has now become the most difficult to increase in supply, more than half the total consumed in the 150 years between the 1860s, when the modern petroleum industry began, and 2010 was burned in the three decades after 1980.

A larger limit that oil represents for democracy is that the political machinery that emerged to govern the age of fossil fuels, partly as a product of those forms of energy, may be incapable of addressing the events that will end it.15 (Location 160)

The term ‘democracy’ can have two kinds of meaning. It can refer to ways of making effective claims for a more just and egalitarian common world. Or it can refer to a mode of governing populations that employs popular consent as a means of limiting claims for greater equality and justice by dividing up the common world. Such limits are formed by acknowledging certain areas as matters of public concern subject to popular decision while establishing other fields to be administered under alternative methods of control.
