TODO: Look into federated wikis

Reasoning

Idea

  + V1

    + Have feed of changes made to digital garden with feed offering chances to comment on changes, which could also be integrated into the digital garden itself

    + Offer some functionality in the reverse direction as well, with discussions or posts (either manually or automatically tagged as related to some content) having some way to be integrated into the digital garden as well

  + V2
    + Laptop: Dual screen with one side being the garden and the other side being the discussion surrounding the current section of the garden that the user is scrolled to

      + Allows single point of entry to discussion which makes the entry point into the conversation much simpler

    + For forks / differing opinions, maybe have different panes that lay on top of each other (like flashcards?) and you can flip through the different opinions?

      + Still need some process to create some sort of consensus out of this

  + 

Purposes

  + Maintaining institutional knowledge and values, including tactic used and learned. Could serve as good onboarding for new members to quickly grasp the most important values of the group

  + Focuses on ideas rather than people. Feels like a lot of leftist organizing devolves into in-fighting and call-outs, and maybe that’s partly because existing social media is really conducive to that. If communication was dedicated to building institutional knowledge, then disputes would focus more on values rather than people

Open questions:

  + What would the primitives of this social media be?

    + I think it would be the block just like LogSeq

  + How would forking/disagreements work?

  + How to maintain ethos of gardening while primarily communicating with others?

    + 1. I think the dual pane approach with the garden on one side and conversations on the other helps ensure that the conversations stay rooted in the ideas/values of the org
2.

  + How to organize content of pages more specifically than just tags

  + How to integrate tools that organizers already trust (e.g. Signal)?

Random thoughts

  + When deciding whether to integrate a conversation into the digital garden or not, prompt user if they'd like to "plant" the conversation

Challenges

  + The challenge is the opportunity with move investment into the way that ideas are structured/connected being the biggest benefit of a community digital garden but also the factor that requires the most investment.

    + One of Graeber's hypotheses in Bullshit Jobs was that the structure of the modern workplace [incentivizes passive consumption that doesn't require too much investment to avoid being caught](Some workers are supervised relentlessly; others are expected to do some token task but are otherwise left more or less alone. Most are somewhere in between. Yet even in the best of cases, the need to be on call, to spend at least a certain amount of energy looking over one’s shoulder, maintaining a false front, never looking too obviously engrossed, the inability to fully collaborate with others—all this lends itself much more to a culture of computer games, YouTube rants, memes, and Twitter controversies than to, say, the rock ’n’ roll bands, drug poetry, and experimental theater created under the midcentury welfare state. What we are witnessing is the rise of those forms of popular culture that office workers can produce and consume during the scattered, furtive shards of time they have at their disposal in workplaces where even when there’s nothing for them to do, they still can’t admit it openly.

)

    + I think the spiritual violence/death discussed in [Bullshit Jobs]({{< ref "/pages/Bullshit Jobs - David Graeber" >}}) also propels the [culture of convenience that incentivizes people to minimize their mental effort](This idea — convenience as liberation — could be intoxicating. Its headiest depictions are in the science fiction and futurist imaginings of the mid-20th century. ... By the late 1960s, the first convenience revolution had begun to sputter. The prospect of total convenience no longer seemed like society’s greatest aspiration. Convenience meant conformity. The counterculture was about people’s need to express themselves, to fulfill their individual potential, to live in harmony with nature rather than constantly seeking to overcome its nuisances. ... Perhaps it was inevitable, then, that the second wave of convenience technologies — the period we are living in — would co-opt this ideal. It would conveniencize individuality. ... Think of the VCR, the playlist, the Facebook page, the Instagram account. This kind of convenience is no longer about saving physical labor — many of us don’t do much of that anyway. It is about minimizing the mental resources, the mental exertion, required to choose among the options that express ourselves.
). When work imposes those kinds of demands, that means that non-work time is [time to recover from work rather than express autonomy](((efee62b1-5e16-4dab-9f8d-e0f30405afd1)))
