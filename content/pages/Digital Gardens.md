The stream and the garden - analogy from this [article](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/)

  + The stream

    + How most of social media operates right now. Content is ordered chronologically/algorithmically and as a result dissolves quickly. You don’t really get a chance to pause the flow of content and revisit ideas, and it’s hard to see the connections between ideas as well.

    + How form affects content:

      + Structure of the stream incentivizes content to be as attention-grabbing as possible **because** it's ephemeral. It necessarily [destroys nuance](Digital abundance is a mixed blessing: exhilarating, yet flattening and homogenizing. Culture is converted into “content” that blurs together as it flows through the same conduits and across the same interfaces in an endless stream. As we struggle to keep abreast of the accelerating flow of content, drawn by the perpetual lure of the new, we come to know less and less about more and more.

).

      + The difficulty of linking to other ideas (e.g. on Tiktok the ways in which you can reference another video are very circumscribed) also means that each idea has to stand alone

      + Requires all content to fit in the same box (e.g. Facebook post, tweet, Tiktok video) which [limits not only experimentation but user desires to experiment](The digital media scholar Jean Burgess has [identified](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780203127711-4/iphone-moment-apple-brand-creative-consumer-jean-burgess) a key tension in technology design between “usability” and “hackability,” the former emphasizing “easy access to a predetermined set of simple operations” and the latter open-ended manipulability and scope for “complex experimentation.” TikTok and many other digital tools and platforms encourage broad participation by making them extremely easy to use. ... Truly democratizing cultural creativity, one might argue, would promote the development of skills and capacities rather than minimize the need for them.
)

  + The garden however is a site of continuous maintenance and thoughtful growth. The thing that really excites me about maintaining a digital garden is having a deeper understanding of the ways that ideas connect as well as being able to use those connections to approach the same ideas in different ways (whether in dialogue with somebody else or just for my own use) using digital gardens could also be truly revolutionary.



Potentially could become new sort of social media as well [Community Digital Gardens]({{< ref "/pages/Community Digital Gardens" >}})
