Games ends are extremely different from the sorts of ends we stand
behind in ordinary life. Our values, in ordinary life, are largely recalci-
trant. Much of what we value seems universal and immoveable. We value
life, freedom, and happiness. ... We can ... change our in-​game ends easily and fluidly. We can adopt new ends, which
will guide our actions for the duration of the game, and then drop them in an
instant. When we play games, we take on temporary agencies—​temporary
sets of abilities and constraints, along with temporary ends. We have a signif-
icant capacity for agential fluidity, and games make full use of that capacity.

We can ... change our in-​game ends easily and fluidly. We can adopt new ends, which
will guide our actions for the duration of the game, and then drop them in an
instant. When we play games, we take on temporary agencies—​temporary
sets of abilities and constraints, along with temporary ends. We have a signif-
icant capacity for agential fluidity, and games make full use of that capacity.

In technical activity, there is some end that we value, and we pursue
it because of the value of that end. Since that end is genuinely valuable, we
try to pursue it as efficiently as we can. But in games, we don’t take the most
efficient route to our in-​game ends. In game playing, we try to achieve some
specified end under certain specified inefficiencies. The end is largely valu-
able only when achieved inside those constraints. We can tell that this is our
motivational structure, precisely because we are willing to set up blockades
to that end. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp7rs90vmjx0c99k3xftws9d))

In striving play, goal and purpose are skew. An
achievement player plays to win. A striving player acquires, temporarily, an
interest in winning for the sake of the struggle. Thus, striving play involves
a motivational inversion from ordinary life. In ordinary practical life, we
pursue the means for the sake of the ends. But in striving play, we pursue
the ends for the sake of the means. We take up a goal for the sake of the ac-
tivity of struggling for it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp7y1cjhmt0tzavbggq12w46))

Games, I claim, are the
crystallization of practicality. Aesthetic experiences of action are natural and
occur outside of games all the time. Fixing a broken car engine, figuring out
a math proof, managing a corporation, even getting into a bar fight—​each
can have its own particular interest and beauty. These include the satisfaction
of finding an elegant solution to an administrative problem, of dodging per-
fectly around an unexpected obstacle. These experiences are wonderful—​but
in the wild, they are far too rare. Games can concentrate those experiences.
When we design games, we can sculpt the shape of the activity to make beau-
tiful action more likely. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp7ybepcy572g35x950grg2h))

Games turn out to be a way of writing down forms
of agency, of inscribing them in an artifact. Games are one of our techniques
for inscribing and recording bits of human experience. We have devel-
oped methods for recording stories: novels, poetry, film, and other kinds
of narrative. We have developed methods for capturing sights: drawing,
painting, photography, and film. W ... And this suggests another possibility: that games can be a way that we col-
laborate in the project of developing our agency and autonomy. If games can
record and transmit forms of agency, then I can learn new modes of agency
from a game. ... Rock climbing
taught me to focus precisely on my balance and precision of motion. Tetris
gave me the mental state required to pack my trunk optimally for a trip. My
suggestion here is more than the familiar old saw that games teach us skills ... and develop our abilities. My claim is that games can teach us the agential
mindsets behind those skills—​the pairings of a particular kind of interest
with a focus on a particular set of abilities.

We can tailor our struggles
in games precisely because our game ends are disposable. But when we try to
make the rest of life like a game, we will need to adapt our enduring ends to
make the struggle more pleasurable and satisfying. When we do that—​when
we instrumentalize our enduring ends as if our lives are a game—​we court
disaster. When we gamify our ordinary lives, we will be tempted to shift and
simplify our ends for the sake of the struggle—​but then we are no longer be
aiming at the same target. Games can be safely tailored precisely because they
are games. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpd7az7mhyrpw4jybtnpd0n0))
