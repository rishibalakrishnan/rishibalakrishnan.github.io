  + I went today and I really enjoyed myself. I was sitting right next to some people that were deeply involved with indigenous justice efforts and it was definitely a new type of conversation to overhear. There were tons of dogs and children running around, and the cafe itself was pretty small with the a book shelf lining the back wall. I met a guy named Ian who carried around a "Personal Ads Book" in which people could jot down a blurb about themselves and their contact information in the hopes that somebody later (who's also about to create an ad) would read about it and contact them. I did one for myself - although now thinking about it I think I forgot to put my number - and texted somebody who said they liked to play table tennis. This idea was entirely unfamiliar to me, and very exciting. I like more local ways to finding, creating, and advertising connections.
