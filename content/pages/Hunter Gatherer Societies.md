Radically egalitarian
  + Based on this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4SDBVaUboc)

  + They lived in harmony in nature and any sense of pride (that came from things like over-hunting) was threatening to both the tribe and nature so males that exhibited these signs were humbled by the tribe

  + Had system of **demand sharing** where anybody that wanted something from someone else could just take it and it was considered very rude to refused - ensured no one person every accumulated too much and is very antithetical to the notion of private property. I'm not sure if a total lack of private property is feasible/desirable but it does suggest a very different set of social relations simply based off of what we are allowed to keep to ourselves
