[Mesh Networks Primer]({{< ref "/pages/Mesh Networks Primer" >}})

Reasons to support

  + 1. More community control over the Internet. This means decreasing the power of ISP's and extending coverage to places where it usually wouldn't be good, if at all present like [NYC Mesh]({{< ref "/pages/NYC Mesh" >}})

2. More resilient to natural disasters because there's no central point of failure

3. More censorship-resistant because the community has control over which web traffic is allowed, which is powerful during a protest.

    + Need to take steps to ensure that privacy is protected
  + 4. I wonder how this could connect to other local-first initiatives, like doing validation for a [[Local Community Currency]] or be connected to [Community Micro-Grid Projects]({{< ref "/pages/Community Micro-Grid Projects" >}})

5. Amenable to local-first communication that doesn't require broader Internet access
