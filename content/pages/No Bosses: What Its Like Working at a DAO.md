To start from the top, dOrg has no general management positions (CEO, CFO, etc). ... Instead, roles are fluid, with people sliding into different roles depending on each project. Everyone who officially works at the company is a legal owner of its Vermont LLC, with each owner owning one share. Company decisions are voted on using tokens, which accrue as you complete projects for the company. ... The company isn’t completely non-hierarchical, however. Specific aspects of projects are led by specialists (i.e. in tech, project management, etc). But, a leader on one project could find themselves reporting to their subordinates on the next one.

Spence says the company used to vote on nearly every decision, which led to an “information overload and a constant barrage of needing to feel like you needed to keep on everything that was being proposed.” While this process was perhaps the most inherently democratic system, it hampered forward progress, so the company began to delegate decisions to smaller and more specialized groups.

All salaries and budgeting are publicly maintained on the blockchain; payout logs are visible to each member.

And employees are paid according to their skillset no matter where they live in the world. ... employees who work on specific projects can elect to either get paid in cash, or in tokens that represent an ownership stake in those projects. If they choose that latter option, they are sacrificing immediate spending money in favor of the idea that the valuation of the tokens will increase as their projects mature.
