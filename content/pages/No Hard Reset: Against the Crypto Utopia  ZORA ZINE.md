Like other technologies, blockchain urbanism cannot replace the fundamentals of urban development, which is to say a human-centered approach. Without the social integration of this technology across all sectors, it’s not a city: it’s just a solution in search of a problem.

the fabled crypto utopia and successful case studies of mixed-reality cities are caught in the same bind: their architecture assumes a lack of trust amongst citizens and governments, with either the full transparency of public chains or the tougher security of private chains pitching to solve the perma-problem of trustlessness. This paradigm is the very inverse of the human-centric approach to urban design that was championed more than half a century ago by Jane Jacobs: that the social life of a city is its magic circle; that trust grows organically and intraoperatively; that community-building is a political act. Relying on technology to automate the commons could end up leading us further and further away from this reconciliation point.

  + This is also what I meant here when talking about [DAO incentives](There’s been thinking about this in the frame of “[ImpactDAO’s](https://store.gitcoin.co/products/green-pill-book-digital-edition)” and “[regenerative cryptoeconomics](https://store.gitcoin.co/products/impactdao-book-digital-edition)” where DAO’s are viewed as the building block of the next society. The part that I really like is the emphasis on modularity and stacking of DAO’s, where if each DAO generates some positive externality and they’re all stacked together, then the positive effects get magnified. This aligns strongly with the socialist ethos of “nobody can do it alone. we all just have to do work in our own little corner and all our efforts together will lead to change”. What I dislike is that all of these fields treat community as something that can be created by designing token incentives **just** right to align every individual’s rational calculus on how to engage in the DAO. That seems a) to miss that human behavior isn’t always rational/optimal in some game-theoretic way and b) incentives to cooperate in some organization need to go beyond what can be programmed into the very human considerations of why people do things for each other.
