There’s an Etruscan word, saeculum, that describes the span of time lived by the oldest person present, sometimes calculated to be about a hundred years. In a looser sense, the word means the expanse of time during which something is in living memory. ... trees seemed to offer another kind of saeculum, a longer time scale and deeper continuity, giving shelter from our ephemerality the way that a tree might offer literal shelter under its boughs.

  + Re-reading this passage is interesting because the rest of the book that I've read so far discusses nature as an investment in the future [like here](“the planting of a tree, especially one of the long-living hardwood trees, is a gift which you can make to posterity at almost no cost and with almost no trouble, and if the tree takes root it will far outlive the visible effect of any of your other actions, good or evil.” (Location 185)
) but this focuses on trees as keepers of the past

an organizer in the Resistance in Paris during the Second World War. ... explored Paris under Nazi occupation, and how at the same time he ... learned to swing dance, because as he wrote in his own memoir, “Swing was really a dance to drive out demons.” ... you might prepare for your central mission in life by doing other things that may seem entirely unrelated, and how necessary this may be.

  + This also seems related to [joy as a practice](“The source of his self-regenerative power lay in his joy in the ordinary, common experiences of day-to-day existence and particularly of contact with nature. “Joy remakes people through combat with forces of subjection [i.e., subjugation]. Joy is a desubjectifying process, an unfixing, an intensification of life itself. It is a process of coming alive and coming apart. Whereas happiness is used as a numbing anesthetic that induces dependence, joy is the growth of people’s capacity to do and feel new things, in ways that can break this dependence.” (Location 717)
) and also makes me think of the importance of prefiguration at least in [designing environments that facilitate satisfaction](((6389042c-aefc-46bb-ae25-3bdd2ca53ed2)))

“the planting of a tree, especially one of the long-living hardwood trees, is a gift which you can make to posterity at almost no cost and with almost no trouble, and if the tree takes root it will far outlive the visible effect of any of your other actions, good or evil.” (Location 185)
a famous Buddhist parable about a person chased by a tiger who, in flight, stumbles over a cliff and grasps a small plant to prevent falling to her death. It’s a strawberry plant that is gradually becoming uprooted and will soon give way, and it has one beautifully ripe strawberry dangling from it. What, asks the parable, is the right thing to do at that moment, and the answer is to savor the berry. It’s a story suggesting that we are always mortal and might die sooner than we think: (Location 415)

“He believed essentially in small communities of neighbours who knew one another very well and therefore he had a great deal of sympathy with the anarchists. . . . Therefore you might say that the basic reason why he wasn’t a Communist was because the Communists weren’t Communists and George Orwell was one.” Like William Morris, he believed that paradise was behind us, in the old ways of life, and in the organic world, rather than ahead of us in an urbanized and industrialized future.

Writing is a murky business: you are never entirely sure what you are doing or when it will be finished and whether you got it right and how it will be received months or years or decades after you finish. ... As a writer, you withdraw and disconnect yourself from the world in order to connect to it in the far-reaching way that is other people elsewhere reading the words that came together in ... this contemplative state. What is vivid in the writing is not in how it hits the senses but what it does in the imagination; ... A garden offers the opposite of the disembodied uncertainties of writing. It’s vivid to all the senses, it’s a space of bodily labor, of getting dirty in the best and most literal way, an opportunity to see immediate and unarguable effect. (Location 669)

  + I wonder if in this way writing is that distinct from other sorts of knowledge work in fostering disconnection from the actual world

Orwell declares, “The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears,” which makes direct observations and firsthand encounters in the material and sensory world likewise acts of resistance or at least reinforcements of the self who can resist. ... In an age of lies and illusions, the garden is one way to ground yourself in the realm of the processes of growth and the passage of time, (Location 682)

Growing food plants can be a touchstone, a way to come back to your senses and your sense of self after wandering in words. Or it can be an encounter with a creative process full of unpredictabilities and interventions, by weather, other creatures, and unforeseen forces, that are very different than what happens on the page (or the computer screen), a collaboration with the nonhuman. (Location 696)

a garden is always a place of becoming, to make and tend one is a gesture of hope, that these seeds planted will sprout and grow, this tree will bear fruit, that spring will come, and so, probably, will some kind of harvest. It’s an activity deeply invested in the future. (Location 715)

“The source of his self-regenerative power lay in his joy in the ordinary, common experiences of day-to-day existence and particularly of contact with nature. “Joy remakes people through combat with forces of subjection [i.e., subjugation].

  + I feel like this also ties in well with the art/imagination stuff that comes later in the book. This analysis of joy feels true on a personal level but also cultivating a joyous imaginary of the future seems to be the way to really get buy in for the futures that the left wants to create.

Art that is not about the politics of this very moment may reinforce a sense of self and society, of values and commitments, or even a capacity to pay attention, that equip a person to meet the crises of the day. (Location 1225)
