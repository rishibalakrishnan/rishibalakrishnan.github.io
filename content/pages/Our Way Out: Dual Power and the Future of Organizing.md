[Dual power](https://www.liberationschool.org/dual-power-and-revolution/) is a two-part strategy that consists of public resistance to oppression (counter-power) and the building of alternative democratic, participatory institutions (counter-institutions). In other words, one part fights the existing systems by mobilizing against them while the other builds resilient, people-led institutions to take their plac ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp03pgcdcr8hc9y0mv3r8vem))

Building digital dual power means building digital democracy - platforms, protocols and toolkits that can be co-designed and co-governed to serve collective needs over individual capital gain. By creating this infrastructure, we can establish freedom from the current digital dictatorship that is designed solely to extract value by selling, surveilling, and data mining. These tools, built under strict demand to return profit, will never be effective agents for anything but extraction. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp03rvj9bdxxbsqrt68kpz3p))

One of the ways we plan on building dual power in the context of web3 is through soft launching our [Breadchain Crowdstaking Application](https://app.breadchain.xyz/) - our engine for funding post-capitalist projects within the Breadchain network.

To participate, all you need is some DAI and MATIC on Polygon and you can start using the application. The application is a smart contract on Polygon that forwards Crowdstakers' DAI into an interest generating Aave lending pool. 100% of the generated interest gets sent to the Breadchain Cooperative which is controlled democratically by its members. In return for giving DAI, Crowdstakers mint (bake) our token, BREAD, as collateral in the same quantity as they gave in DAI. The BREAD token then acts as a digital “local” currency for the Breadchain ecosystem. Digital as in crypto and local not as in geographic locality, but in shared values around cooperativism. Similar to a local currency, it is intended to keep value within the defined locality. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp03zy2661anx2wkb0r51967))
