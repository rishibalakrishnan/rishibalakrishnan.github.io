Separating questions of ownership and governance is an important step because it enables smaller communities to exercise control over services that may require large amounts of capital investment in digital infrastructure

For a privileged few, almost anything can be streamed or delivered straight to your home. For the rest, their job is to label data, assemble products and deliver packages, all to ensure that no cracks appear in the smooth functioning of our automated future.

the platform economy consists of digital platforms that use tech infrastructure to scale the amount of activity that can be facilitated on the platform and reduce transaction costs for users.

explicit policies that regulate how parties will interact and on what terms, digital architects have built online landscapes that encourage certain types of behaviour through a deep understanding of human psychology and motivations built up over decades of social psychology and marketing studies.

My mind’s decision-making process doesn’t default to what I’d find most satisfying — it instead filters for which options would be both respected and easily understood by my audience.

the ceaseless striving for wealth in capitalism destroyed older ways of life and constantly revolutionised the forces of production, initiating the search for ever more sophisticated ways to generate profit. Marx argued that this dynamism distinguished the modern capitalist period from previous epochs and set off an inexorable process in which ‘all fixed, fast-frozen relations … are swept away’ and ‘all that is solid melts into air’.

For generation Xs and millennials who grew up during this period, traditional ‘institutional’ forms of community such as unions, political parties, places of worship, civic associations and social clubs were on the decline, replaced by smaller ‘tribes’ of friends (epitomised by 1990s TV shows like Friends and Seinfeld). Putnam’s research found a receptive audience because the evidence for his thesis was everywhere.
In a 2017 open letter entitled ‘Building Global Communities’, Zuckerberg offered his own take on this theme, which positioned Facebook as offering a potential solution to these social problems. For Zuckerberg, the weakening of social ties began to occur half a century ago:
there has been a striking decline in the important social infrastructure of local communities over the past few decades. Since the 1970s, membership in some local groups has declined by as much as

The neoliberal consensus of the 1980s favoured economic liberalisation, deregulation, privatisation and the expansion of free markets. It also aimed to disrupt social collectives like trade unions and sought to depoliticise political struggles. In their place, neoliberals promoted an ideology of personal responsibility and a host of market-based solutions to individuals’ problems. For generation Xs and millennials who grew up during this period, traditional ‘institutional’ forms of community such as unions, political parties, places of worship, civic associations and social clubs were on the decline, replaced by smaller ‘tribes’ of friends (epitomised b

Community and capitalism are becoming increasingly entwined in a new relationship through digital technology. Notions of community are at the heart of the practices and rhetoric of many of the latest generation of platform companies. Tech companies have

come to see community as a new domain of profitable extraction. Companies profit from our longing for traditional forms of community by stepping into a space left open by globalisation and social disconnection. Community is such a powerful marketing tool because it taps into one of our deepest sources of meaning.

new socio-technical systems that capture and control the bonds of community itself and extract informational resources from them. This leads to a loss of community as a space in which people can come together for free and open dialogue and an experience of collective self-determination. In its place emerges a new kind of enclosed digital community in which connection with others is mediated through corporate digital architectur

One of the key characteristics of platforms is that they enable the extraction of economic value from transactions and interactions without the added responsibility of directly controlling them.

They provide a service to the public that is difficult for them to turn down and hard to obtain in the same way from other sources. This dependency creates a vulnerability to abuse which tech companies can exploit due to their size and power.

Platform socialists agree with the diagnosis of the new regulators but believe that the remedy required is a more thoroughgoing democratisation of the platform economy.

Entrepreneurs within a capitalist system succeed by entering at just the right time when high-risk and low-reward aspects of the research have already been undertaken by other actors

Governments supporting public platforms should invest heavily in research and development to ensure continual innovation in the digital sector. This will drive designers and developers to produce publicly useful apps and systems that fulfil important social needs rather than those that can capture the most value from social activity

Institutions which govern our everyday lives – from national governments to local councils, housing organisations and social media platforms – should be opened to participatory mechanisms that enable ordinary citizens to influence their decision-making

Quadratic Funding allows people to express the strength of their preferences while also ensuring that things that people care about (that aren’t the most important thing) still get funded. Blockchain can help this happen, but the article argued that the framing of blockchain within use cases for public goods and services has to be secondary and fairly technological. The more boring blockchain seems the better as that makes people much more open to the idea.
