**Currently Reading**

  + Games: Agency as Art by C Thi Nguyen

  + Bullshit Jobs - David Graeber: Have heard a lot about this book in particular

**To Read**

  + **Nonfiction**

    + Governing the Commons - Elinor Ostrom: I think that this book will be more academic but especially after reading Less is More I want to read more about the Commons and what it takes to sustain them

    + The User Illusion: Cutting Consciousness Down to Size

    + Braiding Sweetgrass - Robin Wall Kimmerer: Discusses indigenous philosophies wedded with scientific analysis of nature

    + Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution - Peter Krotopkin: Essential anarchist reading and something that I think would solidify my views of nature as cooperative rather than competitive

    + Collective Illusions - Todd Rose

  + **Fiction**

    + The Ministry for the Future - Kim Stanley Robinson

    + Three Body Problem



Started reading but probably won't finish

  + [Orwell's Roses]({{< ref "/pages/Orwell's Roses" >}}): Wanted to read it because it talks about the connection between nature and anti-fascism. Lots of meandering prose though and essays aren't super connected

Want to re-read:

  + [Less Is More]({{< ref "/pages/Less Is More" >}}) - Jason Hickel: About degrowth. Profoundly changed my views about nature and the economy.

  +
