Optimistic movement that reimagines technology as co-constructive with nature rather than oppositional. Focuses on giving power back to local autonomous units and ensuring self-sufficiency. Anti-capitalist.

Local self-sufficiency includes:

  + Local power generating like [Community Micro-Grid Projects]({{< ref "/pages/Community Micro-Grid Projects" >}})

  + Local internet control with [Mesh Networks]({{< ref "/pages/Mesh Networks" >}})

  + Food system based on [Local Farming]({{< ref "/pages/Local Farming" >}})

Such a cool aesthetic
