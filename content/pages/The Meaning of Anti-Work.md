The money we get from work sustains us just enough to keep us coming back to work.Our time away from work is spent travelling to or from work, or getting ready for work.Leisure itself is just nonwork for the sake of work.It’s the limited time we spend recovering from work and trying to distract ourselvesfrom work.Because of work, we’re constantly under the tyranny of the clock.It’s like what Bob Black claims Socrates once said : Manual labourers make bad friends and bad citizens because they have no time to fulfil the responsibilities of friendship and citizenship.He’s right.Our “free” time is not even ours.It still belongs to our bosses in some capacity, so really the only thing free about it is that our bosses don’t have to pay us for it.

Workerism, that is the ideology that encourages the acceptance of, and propaganda for wage-labour, is endemic among so-called revolutionaries, who uphold the “virtues” of exploitation and alienation as a necessary and honourable sacrifice for the building of the state, the economy, and Capital. Workerism specifically often worships the idol of masculine manual labourers, who are said to be most productive, while denigrating service, office, and domestic workers, the latter of which are usually female.

But after centuries of false promises and technological leaps and bounds, we work far more than our ancestors, who had the added benefit of enjoying natural commons and shared knowledges, ever did.The class that destroyed that way of life tells us we should be grateful.They feed us narratives of glorious progress.Yet despite all this so-called progress, which could have liberated us from the need to work if founded on humanity and not capitalism, here we are, still working to death.

The mythology of work insists that work teaches responsibility, but workers check their ownconsciences at the workplace door.The Nuremberg defence of “just following orders” has been employed to avoid accountability for mass pollution, mass animal cruelty, mass wastage, mass destruction, mass surveillance,mass imprisonment, mass enslavement, and mass violence.

Contemporary hunter-gatherers, according to anthropologist Marshall Sahlins, enjoy what he terms “the original affluent society.”They “work” for about four hours per day in total, but based on my earlier definition, what they do can hardly be defined as work.It is not forced labour.Their quests for food are intermittent, leisure abundant, and varied.What they do is more akin to “play”: free activity stimulated by a superabundance of life and the liberty of thought and feeling.Play has been reduced to “mere child’s play,” but play is a far greater and more expansive activity than we might initially recognize.Play is energising and enjoyable.

  + Related to both [Hunter Gatherer Societies]({{< ref "/pages/Hunter Gatherer Societies" >}}) as well as what was said about joy being a [remaking process](“The source of his self-regenerative power lay in his joy in the ordinary, common experiences of day-to-day existence and particularly of contact with nature. “Joy remakes people through combat with forces of subjection [i.e., subjugation]. Joy is a desubjectifying process, an unfixing, an intensification of life itself. It is a process of coming alive and coming apart. Whereas happiness is used as a numbing anesthetic that induces dependence, joy is the growth of people’s capacity to do and feel new things, in ways that can break this dependence.” (Location 717)
