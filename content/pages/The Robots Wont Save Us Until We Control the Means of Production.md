The growing technological edge in finance capital does not mean that we should give up on fighting for the power of machines as tools for worker liberation. But the fact is, the owners own the machines. This is where Marx’s vision for automated liberation gets jammed up. It only works if the workers have control over the tools that are used to oppress them. Now, as in Marx’s time, they typically do not.

That workweek never materialized. Efficiency gains were funneled back to owners. There is nothing to celebrate about exacerbating old problems by smoothing out whatever bumps may sit along the road to exploitation. The uneven manner in which technological gains are distributed has led some thinkers to claim that we will soon enter a period of [techno feudalism](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/techno-feudalism-replacing-market-capitalism-by-yanis-varoufakis-2021-06?barrier=accesspaylog).

Robot landlords are about reducing the workload and costs of property owners who want to maximize their revenue. The application of this technology to housing is utterly dystopian. A healthy society is one in which the distribution of abundance ensures that its members have basic needs met — and housing is one of the most fundamental. Robots entering the real estate game is a sign of a deeply *unhealthy* society. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmv0gf6hxhnnrpqngzdq3qh2))
