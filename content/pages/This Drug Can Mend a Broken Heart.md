“Memory reconsolidation” describes how, when we recall a memory, it can become pliable. There is hope—and some intriguing early data—that, at the moment of recollection, we might be able to intentionally change a memory and make it less burdensome. This ability to modulate distressing memories is being investigated as an intervention to treat [post-traumatic stress disorder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4079131/),1 [addiction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6097762/),2 [phobias](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28380277/),3 and is thought to have promise for depression or anxiety more broadly. It rests on an idea that’s emerged from our understanding of memory over the past few decades: Memories are not fixed, even the ones that haunt us the most.

There could be rules and caveats to using memory reconsolidation as an effective tool that we simply don’t understand yet. [Other research](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2020.598924/full) [into memory reconsolidation](https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(19)30151-1) has found, for example, that updating an existing memory is most effective when the brain gets just enough new information, such as a new stimulus in place of an old one that had triggered fear or loathing.16, 17 If the new information introduced is too strong, a brand *new* memory might be created instead of an alteration to the older memory, and the two memories will compete. “Those are all technical things that people are still figuring out,” Lonergan says.

In his 19th-century essay, “[What Is an Emotion](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2246769),” psychologist William James challenges us to try to imagine an experience of emotion, like anger, without the elements of a racing heart or flushed face. If just the facts of a memory remain, can we really say it’s the same, once it’s been neutered of its emotionality? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmc2r4kc4ha78x0a081yb703))
