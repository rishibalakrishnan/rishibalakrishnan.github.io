[Subnodes](http://subnod.es/), an open source project that turns the under-$50, credit-card-sized [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) computer into a Wi-Fi router equipped with its own local web server and chat room. ... Subnodes could help artists set up local digital art galleries, or help activists or events organizers set up local, short-term message boards without having to work with big ISPs like Comcast or Time Warner Cable. “They could set up a network in a place that wouldn’t normally have connectivity, like a subway, or in a park, or really anywhere, because you’re the source of the network: you’re the server,” she says. “To me, that was really interesting and empowering.”

“The density of a mesh network adds reliability–somebody comes in and out of the network, the routing table updates itself, and you can still get messages from one place to another,” explains Jeff Lunt, a developer who works on a mesh in Chicago, [ChicagoMeshNet](http://chimesh.net/). But keeping track of those routes can get messy. “[With] so many redundant connections, the bandwidth can start to get saturated just with routing table traffic.” ... That is, while the mesh network architecture works well for sending small bits of data from one loosely connected set of computers to another–like disaster relief information or other short messages–it is less useful for holding data for far-flung machines until a path can be found. Mesh networks can quickly get too saturated with data too quickly send a large file, or reliably maintain a connection to a streaming media service. “If you were trying to watch Netflix on a mesh network because you’re trying to use it for Internet service, that’s not going to work,” says Snieckus.

“It’s very different from the urban example, but we do it conceptually for the same reasons: the sort of areas that are underserved by Internet,” says [Jer Thorp](http://blog.blprnt.com/), an artist and data visualization consultant who’ll be helping to build a small mesh network during [an expedition](http://intotheokavango.org/) through remote regions of the Okavango River delta in Angola and Botswana this summer. Wireless sensors deposited during the expedition will monitor water quality in remote parts of the region and form a mesh network to relay data through Internet connections at nearby safari camps.
