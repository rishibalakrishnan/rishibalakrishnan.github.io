Let's talk about Occupy for a minute. How do you view the movement in hindsight? I said it from day one, and I will say it again: It was just a practice. We have a great deal of infrastructure to build before we can really start to talk about independence/autonomy/liberty/justice.

How might democratized tools and technologies play into popular unrest in the future? We will not rely upon tools that are designed to sell us out at our moment of greatest need. We will have longer standing, more robust trust networks (on a human level) to serve as a foundation for deliberation and organization. We are learning, building, communicating, every single day. As the spectacle fades, the dire urgency of our cause comes back into focus.

  + I think this was mentioned in the context of [Mesh Networks]() but it needs to be true of the entire stack

  + Makes me think of whether the same infra that supports mesh networks can also support IPFS, decentralized computing, and maybe block validation (if things like [quadratic voting and participatory budgeting](The podcast and the article discussed Quadratic Voting / Funding and their uses to strengthen democracy, specifically in the context of participatory budgeting. Quadratic Funding allows people to express the strength of their preferences while also ensuring that things that people care about (that aren’t the most important thing) still get funded. Blockchain can help this happen, but the article argued that the framing of blockchain within use cases for public goods and services has to be secondary and fairly technological. The more boring blockchain seems the better as that makes people much more open to the idea.
