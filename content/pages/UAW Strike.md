11/21

  + Joined a couple of the Signal GC's relating to the strike and bargaining

  + UAW bargaining team caved on a cost of living adjustment in favor of 7% yearly raises to keep up with rising housing costs

  + So much disunity in all of the group chats

    + Disagreements around what terms like COLA mean

    + Disagreements about what the power of the strike comes from / when it's highest

    + Personal call-outs and attacks along identity politics lines

  + Really makes me think the [Community Digital Gardens]({{< ref "/pages/Community Digital Gardens" >}}) social media idea is more and more necessary

    + Members in the group chats had to have the same concepts re-explained over and over

    + Very little context behind both the strike and the strategy behind the bargaining team's concessions

11/22
  + Bargaining team decided to hide who voted which way to prevent "harassment" of the BT members

  + Seems like the biggest problem here is one of open communication, where there isn't much direct communication from the union top to the rank and file members who are striking

    + If harassment is occurring it's largely because rank and file feel very out of the loop and unheard
