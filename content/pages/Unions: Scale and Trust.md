As global supply chains have become more distributed since the mid-1990s due to international tariff and trade normalization, conglomerations of firms have been moving away from largely centralized enterprises – those that firm-oriented or trade-specific unions have traditionally been structured around – by shifting activities into component parts, distributed in such a way so as to gain comparative cost advantages in local material and labor markets. The new shape of production is therefore more of a diffuse, global network of firms, national regulatory contexts, and markets containing many and varied forms workers that fall through the cracks of union structures. ... What this structural transformation does is weaken the collective bargaining by centralized or trade-based unions. When the ability for workers to effectively strike at a single firm or locale becomes just one node within an ever-shifting network full of alternatives, the collective leverage power of shutting down the labor supply is radically diminished.

By finding legal and formal organization strategies that mirror this new model of production, labor could institutionalize entities for collective bargaining that alleviate the power firms have over them. One way to do this could be to vertically integrate labor organizations down the supply chain in order to create a vertical monopoly on the labor supply. This translates into organizing workers across sectors and across national boundaries in addition to horizontally within a given sector with a more explicit focus on the efficacy of direct action measures such as strikes; garnering more urgent and direct means for leveraging demands in the face of formidable legal and political conditions.
