We simply do not have anything like a theory of populism, and we seem to lack coherent criteria for deciding when political actors turn populist in some meaningful sense.

it is a necessary but not sufficient condition to be critical of elites in order to count as a populist

populists are always antipluralist. Populists claim that they, and they alone, represent the people.

populism is always a form of identity politics (though not all versions of identity politics are populist)

populists justify their conduct by claiming that they alone represent the people; this allows populists to avow their practices quite openly

Populism is seen as a threat but also as a potential corrective for a politics that has somehow become too distant from “the people.”

Populism, I argue, is not anything like a codified doctrine, but it is a set of distinct claims and has what one might call an inner logic. When that logic is examined, one discovers that populism is not a useful corrective for a democracy that somehow has come to be too “elite-driven,” as many observers hold.

Setting up a distinction between populism

A number of surveys have shown that one’s personal socioeconomic situation and support for right-wing populist parties often do not correlate at all, because the latter is based on a much more general assessment of the situation of one’s country

One should be very careful indeed about using such loaded terms as “frustration,” “anger,” and especially “resentment” to explain populism. There are at least two reasons for this. First, while commentators invoking a term like resentment might not be rehearsing Nietzsche’s The Genealogy of Morality in the back of their minds, it is hard to see how one could entirely avoid certain connotations of ressentiment. Those suffering from resentment are by definition weak, even if in Nietzsche’s analysis those consumed by resentment can become creative, with the cleverest among the weak vanquishing the strong by reordering the rank of human values. The resentful are nonetheless defined by their inferiority and their reactive character.17 They feel bad about the strong and bottle up that feeling; their self-understanding is thus fundamentally dependent on the strong, as they ultimately long for proper recognition by the superior. In that sense, the resentful are always incapable of anything like autonomous conduct. They have to keep lying to themselves about their own actual condition, even if they can never quite believe their own lies. As Max Scheler put it, resentment leads humans slowly to poison their own souls.18

“resentment” to explain populism

The resentful are nonetheless defined by their inferiority and their reactive character.17 They feel bad about the strong and bottle up that feeling; their self-understanding is thus fundamentally dependent on the strong, as they ultimately long for proper recognition by the superior. In that sense, the resentful are always incapable of anything like autonomous conduct.

the origins of “populism” in the United States in particular still suggests to many observers that populism must at least on some level be “popular” in the sense of favoring the least advantaged or bringing the excluded into politics

Populism, I suggest, is a particular moralistic imagination of politics, a way of perceiving the political world that sets a morally pure and fully unified—but, I shall argue, ultimately fictional—people against elites who are deemed corrupt or in some other way morally inferior.

In addition to being antielitist, populists are always antipluralist: populists claim that they, and only they, represent the people.27

Populists hanker after what the political theorist Nancy Rosenblum has called “holism”: the notion that the polity should no longer be split and the idea that it’s possible for the people to be one and—all of them—to have one true representative.

Put in terms derived from ancient Rome, fighting for the interests of the plebs, “the common people,” is not populism, but saying that only the plebs (as opposed to the patrician class, never mind the slaves) is the populus Romanus—and that only a particular kind of populares properly represents the authentic people—is populism.

There are a variety of ways for a populist to distinguish moral and immoral. What will always need to be present is some distinction between the morally pure people and their opponents.

the emphasis on a singular common good that is clearly comprehensible to common sense and capable of being articulated as a singularly correct policy that can be collectively willed at least partly explains why populism is so often associated with the idea of an oversimplification of policy challenges.

“the people themselves” is a fictional entity outside existing democratic procedures, a homogeneous and morally unified body whose alleged will can be played off against actual election results in democracies

As long they are in opposition, populists will always invoke an uninstitutionalized people “out there”—in existential opposition to officeholders who have been authorized by an actual election, or even just opinion polls, which fail to reflect what populists see as the true popular will.

populists are not even inherently antielitist, if one takes the latter to mean that power should always be as widely dispersed as possible.

Trump if one points out that he is in fact part of the existing elite (albeit not the political elite in a narrow sense); the same is true of businessmen-turned-politicians in Europe, such as the Swiss populist Christoph Blocher. They know that they are part of the elite, and so do their supporters; what matters is their promise that as a proper elite, they will not betray the people’s trust and will in fact faithfully execute the people’s unambiguously articulated political agenda.

t is thus no accident that populists in power (about whom I have to say more in the next chapter) often adopt a kind of “caretaker” attitude toward an essentially passive people

Populists assume that “the people” can speak with one voice and issue something like an imperative mandate that tells politicians exactly what they have to do in government

hus there is no real need for debat

Political scientists have long argued that a completely coherent, single “popular will” is a fantasy51 and that no one can credibly claim, as Juan Perón used to do, that “the political leader is the one who does what the people want.”

Conspiracy theories are thus not a curious addition to populist rhetoric; they are rooted in and emerge from the very logic of populism itself.

Principled, moralized antipluralism and the reliance on a noninstitutionalized notion of “the people” also helps explain why populists so frequently oppose the “morally correct” outcome of a vote to the actual empirical result of an election

But he or she has to provide a sense of a direct connection with the “substance” of the people and, even better, with every single individual.

There is a reason they want to be a “front” (as in Front National), a “movement,” or indeed a foundation.65 A party is just a

part (of the people), whereas populists put forward the claim to stand for the whole, without remainder.

What distinguishes democratic politicians from populists is that the former make representative claims in the form of something like hypotheses that can be empirically disproven on the basis of the actual results of regular procedures and institutions like elections.6

Populism is not just any mobilization strategy that appeals to “the people”;72 it employs a very specific kind of language. Populists do not just criticize elites; they also claim that they and only they represent the true people.

hile populist parties do indeed protest against elites, this does not mean that populism in government will become contradictory.

Many populist victors continue to behave like victims

Populist will often eagerly frame a situation as a crisis, calling it an existential threat, because such a crisis then serves to legitimate populist governance.

This logic can manifest itself in three distinct ways: a kind of colonization of the state, mass clientelism as well as what political scientists sometimes call “discriminatory legalism,” and, finally, the systematic repression of civil society.

Populists in power tend to be harsh (to say the least) with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that criticize them.

opposition from within civil society creates a particular moral and symbolic problem: it potentially undermines their claim to exclusive moral representation of the people.

While they may have won an initial election fair and square, they quickly start tampering with the institutional machinery of democracy in the name of the so-called real people (as opposed to their political opponents, who are automatically deemed traitors to the nation).

populism is inherently hostile to the mechanisms and, ultimately, the values commonly associated with constitutionalism: constraints on the will of the majority, checks and balances, protections for minorities, and even fundamental rights

populists are not generally “against institutions,” and they are not destined to self-destruct once in power. They only oppose those institutions that, in their view, fail to produce the morally (as opposed to empirically) correct political outcomes. And that happens only when they are in opposition. Populists in power are fine with institutions—which is to say, their institutions.

constitutions might achieve for populists: they can help to keep populists in power.

as the only legitimate representatives of the people, populists should perpetually be in office. And if the perpetuation of power becomes the aim, then there is also the possibility that populists will treat the constitution as a mere façade, while operating quite differently behind that façade.

the populist ideal became reality in the form of strengthening the executive while diminishing the power of the judiciary and/or staffing judicial offices with partisan actors. Thus the new constitutions helped decisively in the populist project of “occupying the state,” as the shift to a new constitution justified the replacement of existing office holders

Populist constitutions are designed to limit the power of nonpopulists, even when the latter form the government. Conflict then becomes inevitable.

Once the stakes are raised to the level of nonnegotiable identity claims, continuous conflict appears likely.

those fighting for inclusion have rarely claimed “We and only we are the people.” On the contrary, they have usually claimed “We are also the people” (with attendant claims of “we also represent the people” by various leaders).

democracy suffers from a permanent crisis of representation.

It is actually populists who break off the chain of claim-making by asserting that the people can now be firmly and conclusively identified—and that the people is now actual and no longer latent. It is a kind of final claim.

he success of populism can be connected to what one might call promises of democracy that have not been fulfilled and that in a certain sense simply can’t be fulfilled in our societies

The crucial promise, simply put, is that the people can rule.

The crucial promise, simply put, is that the people can rule. At least in theory, populists claim that the people as a whole not only have a common and coherent will but also can rule in the sense that the right representatives can implement what the people have demanded in the form of an imperative mandate.

populists speak as if such promises could be fulfilled. They speak and act as if the people could develo

a singular judgment, a singular will, and hence a singular, unambiguous mandate. They speak and act as if the people were one—with any opposition, if its existence is acknowledged at all, soon to disappear. They speak as if the people, if only they empowered the right representatives, could fully master their fate.

they do not talk about the collective capacity of the people as such, and they do not pretend that the people could actually themselves occupy the offices of the state

emocracy and populism should have become clear by now: one enables majorities to authorize representatives whose actions may or may not turn out to conform to what a majority of citizens expected or would have wished for; the other pretends that no action of a populist government can be questioned, because “the people” have willed it so

The major differences between democracy and populism should have become clear by now: one enables majorities to authorize representatives whose actions may or may not turn out to conform to what a majority of citizens expected or would have wished for; the other pretends that no action of a populist government can be questioned, because “the people” have willed it so. The one assumes fallible, contestable judgments by changing majorities; the other imagines a homogeneous entity outside all institutions whose identity and ideas can be fully represented. The one assumes, if anything, a people of individuals, so that in the end only numbers (in elections) count; the other takes for granted a more or less mysterious “substance” and the fact that even large numbers of individuals (even majorities) can fail to express that substance properly. The one presumes that decisions made after democratic procedures have been followed are not “moral” in such a way that all opposition must be considered immoral; the other postulates one properly moral decision even in circumstances of deep disagreement about morality (and policy). Finally—and most importantly—the one takes it that “the people” can never appear in a noninstitutionalized manner and, in particular, accepts that a majority (and even an “overwhelming majority,” a beloved term of Vladimir Putin) in parliament is not “the people” and cannot speak in the name of the people; the other presumes precisely the opposite.

  + **Note**: probably the most important passage in the book

democracy is a system where you know you can lose, but you also know that you will not always lose. Parties formed governments and legitimate oppositions; their very existence as legitimate “parts” (as opposed to “the whole”) had an antipopulist meaning.

he “boundary problem.” It famously has no obvious democratic solution: to say that the people should decide presumes that we already know who the people are—but that is the very question that demands an answer.

charge against populists that they are exclusionary is a normative one, but liberal democrats—unless they advocate for a world state with one single, equal citizenship status—also effectively condone exclusions of all those not part of a particular state

accepting pluralism is not a recognition of the empirical fact that we live in diverse societies; rather, it amounts to a commitment to try to find fair terms of sharing the same political space with others whom we respect as free and equal but also as irreducibly different in their identities and interests.

The United States today requires deep structural reform in this respect, and someone like Bernie Sanders clearly is right to draw attention to such a need. As should have become clear by now, Sanders is not a left-wing populist, if one is at all persuaded by the criteria developed in this book.

populism is actually not really a cry for more political participation, let alone for the realization of direct democracy. But it can resemble movements making such cries and hence, prima facie, gain some legitimacy on the grounds that the postwar European order really is based on the

For neither technocrats nor populists is there any need for democratic debate. In a sense, both are curiously apolitical. Hence it is plausible to assume that one might pave the way for the other, because each legitimizes the belief that there is no real room for disagreement. After all, each holds that there is only one correct policy solution and only one authentic popular will respectively.

Broad-based support is required for such a new social contract in Southern European countries, and that support can only be built through an appeal to fairness, not just fiscal rectitude.
