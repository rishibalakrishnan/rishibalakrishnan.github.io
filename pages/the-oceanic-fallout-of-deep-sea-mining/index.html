And while mining companies say these risks can be mitigated, some scientists question whether it’s even possible to fully predict the far-flung effects of seabed mining, and doubt whether it’s sensible to proceed if the consequences are so poorly understood. Already, says Craig Smith, a biological oceanographer and marine ecologist at the University of Hawai’i at Manoa, “it’s really, really clear that the spatial impact of a single deep-sea mining operation will be enormous.” (View Highlight)\nReminds me of a lot of the highlights in Less Is More where it’s constantly discussed how interconnected the ecosystem is Another major concern for Smith is noise, which will emanate not only from collector vehicles but also from riser pipes that pump ore to ships far above. He and his colleagues recently used acoustic data from dredging equipment operated in shallow waters to model the potential impacts of deep-sea mining noise; they found that mining operations will produce a zone of sound spreading outward.7 If each of those 17 companies operate a single mine in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, the whole zone will be bathed in sound that surpasses normal noise levels. Over time the din could lead to stress and hearing loss in many species and interfere with their communication; some of the sound could enter a water layer around 3,300 feet deep that transmits sound efficiently over long distances and is used for communication by whales. (View Highlight)\nDisrupting seafloor life may have other far-reaching impacts. The dynamics of sediment-dwelling organisms help shape the fate of global nutrient cycles: As organic materials rain down from above, for example, some of the carbon they contain ends up buried under the sediment, creating a slow yet important pathway for planet-warming carbon to be locked away from the atmosphere. That long-term process could be perturbed by seabed mining,10 although it’s not an immediate problem as this takes place over long timescales, says Beth Orcutt, a microbial biogeochemist at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences.

In the rush to harvest these metals, nearly 600,000 square miles of the deep seafloor has already been set aside for commercial exploration, with much more expected to follow.
